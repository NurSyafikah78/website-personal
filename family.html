	<p> My family is quite big, we got nine (9) in total! All of us were born</p>
	<p>in Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu.I have seven (7) siblings which consists of two (2) sisters and 
	<p>four (4) brothers.As I already mentioned before, I’m the seventh out of seventh! </p>

	<br>

	<p> My parents were both from the year of 80’s and even if it sounds <p>
	<p>cliché, they are the greatest parents and I’m proud to address them like that to people </p>
	<p> who don’t even know them yet. The oldest one in my siblings is a woman, a strong one at that. </p>
	<p>She’s thirty-three (33) years old and her name is Norhan. The second one is Fatihat </p>
	<p>and she is thirty-two (32) years old. We love to call her as as our second mother, </p>
	<p> because that is how important she is in our in our family. She might not know this, </p>
	<p>but she is the sole reason why I even bother to do well on my studies. All of my family </p>
	<p>play the biggest roles in my life, but I would like to name her as the most loveable. </p>

	<br> 

	<p>All the next third till sixth siblings are guys. Started from the age of thirty (30) </p>
	<p>years old, twenty-eight (28) years old, twenty-seven (27) years old, and twenty-three (23) years old.</p>
	<p>Their names are actually quite easy to remember. Started from Wahid, Zulkarnain, </p>
	<p>Firdaus and Amiruddin. Might have to thank my parents for giving us the simplest names </p>
	<p>as it will be easy to keep their names in most of my prayers. <p>

	<br>

	<p> This big family have shared tons of amazing memories, even the sad one </p>
	<p> I’m not the one who love to express myself, but wholeheartedly, </p>
	<p> I love them. I might be young and reckless, but I put them </p>
	<p>on my priority lists. There were none above them, and I’m glad </p>
	<p> that I still have them all. </p>
