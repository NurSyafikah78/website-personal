		<h1>About Me :)</h1>

		<br>

		<font color="black" font size="4" style="left: 0">
		<p align="center">People known me as Fee
		because that is literally 
		my nickname. </p> 
		<p align="center">My full name is 
		Nur Syafikah Binti Ramli
		and currently sitting on 
		my last year in university! </p> 
		<br>

		<p align="center">I'm 21 years old and I'm 
		the seventh our of seventh siblings in my family. </p>
		<p align="centert">Quite contrary of my real life features,
		I am an introvert person. </p>
		<p align="center">Albeit I'm friendly 
		with other people, </p>
		<p align="center"> I tend to 
		love my own personal 
		space and totally love
		being alone. </p>
		<br>

		<p align="center">I love to read books namely 
		online which is E-Books. </p>
		<p align="center"> Books at the library are fine! But E-Books 
		are convenient and really easy to get. </p>
		<p align="center">People might assume I have a 
		relationship going on, but actually it is none. 
		<p align="center"> Why? It is as simple as men tend
		to fail me all the time. </p> 
		<p align="center">So I thought, why bother?
		I live my life to the fullest, not by 
		unnecessary commitment!</p>
